When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Fill in your answer here : When collaborating with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Fill in your answer here : Changes can cause conflicts. If you are in the process of creating a new feature, you don't want to solve
    those conflicts but finish your feature first. This way you can keep focus and decide when you want to get the latest versions and
    integrate changes. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fill in your answer here : Branches are emerging from master branch which are in the same repository.
    Clones are clones of GitHub or local repositories to new local location.
    Forks are clones from others GitHub repositories to your new made repository on GitHub.  

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Fill in your answer here : It helps in avoiding the conflicts and keeps your local copy up-to-date. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Fill in your answer here : Without Git or GitHub I have to sent the files over via e-mail/google drive/dropbox etc. Using this will make it hard to trake changes made to the files and harder to combine your work with others.
    Other techniques is simpler but Git and GitHub need to learn how Git and GitHub works.While, using Git and Github make it easier to track history of changes and combine your work with others.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Fill in your answer here : When you working with others it is better to make a separate branch to keep the master branch working well and to avoid conflicts as much as possible but it is more complicated in merging all changes into the master branch. 
    While in working directly with the master branch it is easier in merging and it would be better in situations when there is only a few changes.
